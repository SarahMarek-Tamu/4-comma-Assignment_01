## Abstract
This project explores creating a yonkoma by combining AI-generated scripts and images with hand-drawn art. It investigates blending AI tools and traditional methods to accelerate the creative process while maintaining a visual narrative. The goal is to highlight how AI can enhance human creativity in digital and traditional workflows.

## Introduction and Related Works

The struggle to find motivation and the complexities of procrastination are themes that resonate with many, including myself. I was drawn to explore these concepts in a manga format because of manga’s ability to capture both the emotional depth and humor that comes with such personal challenges. The story follows a character who is stuck in a cycle of procrastination, trying various methods to overcome it but finding it hard to get started.
For this project, I used ChatGPT to help generate the script, exploring how AI could aid in brainstorming ideas, structuring narratives, and revising drafts. ChatGPT allowed me to rapidly generate a variety of ideas, from dialogue to scenarios, helping overcome writer’s block. After generating the script, I refined it to ensure the voice was consistent and reflective of the intended themes.
Combining AI-generated imagery with hand-drawn illustrations provided an interesting challenge. AI tools like DALL·E allowed me to generate background scenes and character designs, while the hand-drawn art added a personal touch, capturing the human imperfections and details that give the manga its emotional impact. This process blends recent advancements in AI-driven creativity, as seen in works by authors such as Li et al. (2023), Kim & Yoon (2022), and Tanaka et al. (2024).

### Built With

ChatGPT, Leonadro.ai, perchance.org/ai-anime-generator, and Adobe Photoshop

## Methodology

The creation of this manga was a multi-step process that combined AI tools with traditional art techniques to create a hybrid narrative. Initially, I turned to ChatGPT to generate ideas and draft the script, specifying the themes of procrastination, motivation struggles, and the emotional toll of avoiding work. The AI helped generate dialogue and outlined scenes based on these themes, providing a structured foundation for the story. Once the first draft was ready, I revised the script, adjusting it for tone, pacing, and the intended message.
For the artwork, I used AI tools to generate rough background images and character designs based on the descriptions in the script. I employed DALL·E to produce images that captured the essence of the environments and characters. However, to preserve the manga’s personal touch, I then incorporated hand-drawn elements, refining the characters and adding detail to the images. The hand-drawn art not only brought more authenticity but also allowed me to maintain control over the emotional expression of the characters.
The combination of AI-generated backgrounds and hand-drawn figures enabled me to create detailed and visually dynamic scenes. I carefully documented each step, ensuring that others could reproduce the process of blending AI tools with traditional artistry. This was important for ensuring transparency in the creative process.

## Result and Future Work
The manga successfully conveyed the emotional journey of struggling with motivation. The hybrid technique of using AI-generated images combined with hand-drawn art allowed for a fresh, modern take on the classic manga style, while preserving a deeply personal narrative. If revisiting the project, I would explore enhancing the interaction between characters and their environment by incorporating more dynamic AI tools for character animation. Future projects could expand on this hybrid approach, experimenting with interactive elements or incorporating deeper AI-driven storytelling to further enhance the visual and emotional experience.



## Conclusion
Creating this manga was a valuable experiment in blending AI tools with traditional art forms. The process highlighted the power of collaboration between human creativity and machine assistance, yielding a new approach to storytelling. The experience reinforced the importance of innovation while maintaining authenticity in creative endeavors.
